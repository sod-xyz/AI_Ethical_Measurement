5. **Access Your Account Securely**: Instead of using the link in the email, go directly to your brokerage's website by typing the URL into your browser or using a bookmark you know is safe.

6. **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**: If your brokerage offers it, enable two-factor authentication for an added layer of security.
